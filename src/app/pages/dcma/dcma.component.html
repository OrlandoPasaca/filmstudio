HiddenSoft.net takes matters of Intellectual Property very seriously and is committed to meeting the needs of content owners while helping them manage publication of their content online. It should be noted that HiddenSoft.net is a simple search engine of videos available at a wide variety of third party websites.

Any videos shown on third party websites are the responsibility of those sites and not HiddenSoft.net.

HiddenSoft.net does not host any content on its servers or network. HiddenSoft.net is a pro-DMCA website and as such Content Owners can use the DMCA protocol to request removal of links to videos that they believe infringe their copyright.

Content owners must understand that by having a link removed from HiddenSoft.net they will not be removing the actual source video from the 3rd party site. Content owners must contact the video hosting site themselves to request removal.
